## Introduction to Small Samples and the t-Statistic {.font80}

::: cle6
- **Small Samples**: In research, we sometimes only have access to a small number of observations, which limits the effectiveness of the Central Limit Theorem.
- **Need for a Different Approach**: Traditional z-statistics assume a large sample size to normalize sample means, which is not feasible with small samples. This session introduces the student's t-statistic, a better-suited approach for such scenarios.
:::

## Challenges with Small Samples {.font70}

::: cle13
- **Normality Assumption**: For samples smaller than 30, the distribution of the population must be approximately normal for the sample mean $\bar{x}$ to be considered normally distributed. For example, if you're studying the heights of a rare species of plant, and can only find a few samples, the underlying distribution of these heights must be normal for standard approaches to work.
- **Standard Deviation Issues**: When using the sample standard deviation $s$ in place of the population standard deviation $\sigma$, the estimate becomes less reliable with smaller samples. Consider a scenario where you measure the amount of a chemical in water samples from different locations. With only a few samples, the variability in your measurements could significantly affect the reliability of your estimates, leading to potentially misleading conclusions.

## Introducing the Student's t-Statistic {.font80}

::: cle14
Given the issues identified with small samples, the Student's t-statistic offers a refined method for estimating population parameters:
$$
T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$
This formula adjusts for the additional uncertainty inherent in small samples.
:::

## Comparison with the z-Statistic {.font80}

::: cle10
The t-statistic is analogous to the z-statistic used for larger samples, where the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known or the sample is large enough ($n \geq 30$) for reliable approximation:
$$
Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$
:::

## Why Use the t-Distribution? {.font80}

::: cle11
- **Degrees of Freedom**: The shape of the t-distribution and its variability depend on the degrees of freedom (df = $n-1$), which adjusts as the sample size changes. This flexibility makes it particularly useful for small sample sizes.
