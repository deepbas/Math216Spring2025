## Introduction to Small Samples and the t-Statistic {.font80}

::: cle6
- **Small Samples**: In research, we sometimes only have access to a small number of observations, which limits the effectiveness of the Central Limit Theorem.
- **Need for a Different Approach**: Traditional z-statistics assume a large sample size to normalize sample means, which is not feasible with small samples. This session introduces the student's t-statistic, a better-suited approach for such scenarios.
:::

## Challenges with Small Samples {.font70}

::: cle13
- **Normality Assumption**: For samples smaller than 30, the distribution of the population must be approximately normal for the sample mean $\bar{x}$ to be considered normally distributed. For example, if you're studying the heights of a rare species of plant, and can only find a few samples, the underlying distribution of these heights must be normal for standard approaches to work.
- **Standard Deviation Issues**: When using the sample standard deviation $s$ in place of the population standard deviation $\sigma$, the estimate becomes less reliable with smaller samples. Consider a scenario where you measure the amount of a chemical in water samples from different locations. With only a few samples, the variability in your measurements could significantly affect the reliability of your estimates, leading to potentially misleading conclusions.
:::

## Introducing the Student's t-Statistic {.font80}

::: cle14
Given the issues identified with small samples, the Student's t-statistic offers a refined method for estimating population parameters:
$$
T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$
This formula adjusts for the additional uncertainty inherent in small samples.
:::

## Comparison with the z-Statistic {.font80}

::: cle10
The t-statistic is analogous to the z-statistic used for larger samples, where the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known or the sample is large enough ($n \geq 30$) for reliable approximation:
$$
Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$
:::

## Why Use the t-Distribution? {.font80}

::: cle11
- **Degrees of Freedom**: The shape of the t-distribution and its variability depend on the degrees of freedom (df = $n-1$), which adjusts as the sample size changes. This flexibility makes it particularly useful for small sample sizes.

> Example 1: Consider the pharmaceutical company that desires an estimateof the mean increase in blood pressure of patients who take a new drug. The blood pressure increases (measured in points) for the n $=6$ patients in the human testing phase are shown in the following. Use this information to construct a $95 \%$ confidence interval for $\mu$, the mean increase in blood pressure associated with the new drug for all patients in the population.

\begin{align*}
\begin{array}{llllll}
1.7 & 3.0 & 0.8 & 3.4 & 2.7 & 2.1
\end{array}
\end{align*}

(From R/hand calculation, $\bar{x}=2.283, s=0.950$ )

> Example 2: Some quality control experiments require destructive sampling (i.e., the test to determine whether the item is defective destroys the item) in order to measure a particular characteristic of the product. The cost of destructive sampling often dictates small samples. Suppose a manufacturer of printers for personal computers wishes to estimate the mean number of characters printed before the printhead fails. The printer manufacturer tests $n=15$ printheads and records the number of characters printed until failure for each. These 15 measurements (in millions of characters) are listed in the following table.

b. What assumption is required for the interval you found in part a to be valid? Is that assumption reasonably satisfied?
