## Activity 1: Quiz


- **Question**: Given the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu_{\text{A}} = \mu_{\text{B}}$ and the alternative hypothesis $H_a: \mu_{\text{A}} > \mu_{\text{B}}$, what does rejecting $H_0$ imply about the effectiveness of Method A compared to Method B?
- **Options**:
  - A) Method A is less effective than Method B.
  - B) Method A is equally effective as Method B.
  - C) Method A is more effective than Method B.
  - D) The test is inconclusive.



## Activity 2: Case Studies and Problem-Solving


- **Case Study**: An experiment is conducted to compare the starting salaries of male and female college graduates who find jobs. Pairs are formed by choosing a male and a female with the same major and similar GPAs. The data is provided in the table below. Use $\alpha=0.05$ to perform a hypothesis test to see if the data provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that "the male average starting salary is greater than the female average starting salary."

| Pair | Male | Female | Difference Male - Female |
|------|------|--------|--------------------------|
| 1    | 29,300 | 28,800 | 500 |
| 2    | 41,500 | 41,600 | -100 |
| 3    | 40,400 | 39,800 | 600 |
| 4    | 38,500 | 38,500 | 0 |
| 5    | 43,500 | 42,600 | 900 |
| 6    | 37,800 | 38,000 | -200 |
| 7    | 69,500 | 69,200 | 300 |
| 8    | 41,200 | 40,100 | 1,100 |
| 9    | 38,400 | 38,200 | 200 |
| 10   | 59,200 | 58,500 | 700 |

1. **Analyze**: Perform a paired t-test on the salary data.
2. **Interpret**: Discuss the results, including the p-value and confidence interval.
3. **Conclude**: Determine whether the data supports the claim that male graduates earn more than female graduates.


```{webr}
diff <- c(500, -100, 600, 0, 900, -200, 300, 1100, 200, 700)
# Perform the paired t-test
t.test(diff, alternative = "greater")
```

## **Activity 3: Exam Improvement**


A teacher gives a pre-test and post-test to 8 students. Did scores improve? Test with α=0.05.  

**Data**:  

```{webr}
pre <- c(65, 72, 58, 83, 90, 75, 62, 68)
post <- c(72, 75, 65, 88, 92, 82, 70, 73)
```


1. Run the paired t-test:  

```{webr}
t.test(post, pre, paired=TRUE, alternative="greater")
```
2. Report the p-value. Is the improvement significant?  



## **Activity 4: Drug Effectiveness**


A drug claims to reduce blood pressure. Test with α=0.05 using this data from 6 patients (mmHg):  

**Data**:  

```{webr}
before <- c(140, 155, 132, 148, 160, 135)
after <- c(132, 145, 130, 140, 152, 128)
```

**Steps**:  

1. Verify normality of differences:  

```{webr}
differences <- before - after
shapiro.test(differences)  
```

2. Run the test:  

```{webr}
t.test(before, after, paired=TRUE, alternative="greater")
```

3. **Output**:
