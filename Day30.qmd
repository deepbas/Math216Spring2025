## Wilcoxon Test in R {.font60}

::: cle12

### One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test
Used to test whether the median of a single sample differs from a hypothesized value.

```r
wilcox.test(x, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

### Paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test
Used for paired samples to test whether the median difference is significantly different from zero.

```r
wilcox.test(x, y, paired = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

### Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U Test)
Used to compare medians of two independent samples.

```r
wilcox.test(x ~ group, data = dataset, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

## Additional Statistical Tests in R {.font60}

::: cle12

### z-Test for Known Population Variance
Used when the population variance is known.

```r
z.test(x, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, sigma.x = 1, conf.level = 0.95)
```

### t-Test for Comparing Means
Used to compare means of two groups.

```r
t.test(x, y = NULL, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

:::


## zsum.test and tsum.test in BSDA Package {.font60}

::: cle6
The `zsum.test` and `tsum.test` functions from the BSDA package are designed for conducting z-tests and t-tests using summarized data. These functions are particularly useful when individual data points are not available, and only summary statistics are available.

### zsum.test
Performs a z-test on summarized data.

```r
zsum.test(mean.x, sigma.x, n.x, mean.y, sigma.y, n.y, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, conf.level = 0.95)
```

### tsum.test
Performs a t-test on summarized data.

```r
tsum.test(mean.x, s.x, n.x, mean.y, s.y, n.y, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 0, var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

## Analysis of Exam Scores: Online vs Traditional Classroom {.font80}

::: cle8

Two groups of students, one taking an online class and the other in a traditional classroom setting, were given the same final exam. Here are the scores:

- **Online**: 78, 82, 83, 87, 75, 43, 78, 42, 94, 47, 98, 90, 97, 81
- **Traditional**: 83, 82, 92, 100, 74, 90, 44, 84, 77, 89, 70, 34

We want to determine if there's a statistically significant difference between the exam scores of the two groups using a non-parametric test.

:::



## Hypothesis Test Setup {.font80}

::: cle9

We will perform a Mann-Whitney U test, which does not assume a normal distribution of the scores.

### Hypotheses
- **Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: There is no difference in the median scores between the two classes.
- **Alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)**: There is a difference in the median scores between the two classes.

### Significance Level
- **$\alpha = 0.05$**: This is the threshold for determining statistical significance.

:::


## Mann-Whitney U Test in R {.font70}

::: cle12

First, we'll enter the exam scores into R and perform the test.

```{r}
online_scores <- c(78, 82, 83, 87, 75, 43, 78, 42, 94, 47, 98, 90, 97, 81)
traditional_scores <- c(83, 82, 92, 100, 74, 90, 44, 84, 77, 89, 70, 34)
```

Next, we use the `wilcox.test()` function to conduct the Mann-Whitney U test.

```{r}
wilcox.test(online_scores, traditional_scores, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```
