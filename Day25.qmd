## Introduction to Small Sample Confidence Intervals {.font80}

::: cle6
- **Background**: Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for large samples ($n \geq 30$) rely on the $z$-statistic.
- **Challenge**: What happens with a small sample size ($n < 30$) where the Central Limit Theorem does not apply?

:::

## Adjusting for Small Samples {.font70}

::: cle6
- **Population Distribution**: If the sample comes from an approximately normal distribution, we can use the $t$-statistic.
- **Standard Deviation**: When the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is unknown and $n < 30$, using the sample standard deviation $s$ to approximate $\sigma$ is unreliable.
- **Solution**:
  $$
  t=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
  $$
  - Follows a $t$-distribution with degrees of freedom, $df = n-1$.
:::



## Confidence Interval Using Student's t-Statistic {.font80}

::: cle9
- **When $\sigma$ is unknown**: Use the $t$-statistic for confidence intervals.
  - For a $95\%$ confidence interval:
    $$
    \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
    $$
    where $t_{\alpha/2}$ is determined from the $t$-distribution table for $df = n-1$.

> Example 1: Consider the pharmaceutical company that desires an estimate of the mean increase in blood pressure of patients who take a new drug. The blood pressure increases (measured in points) for the $n=6$ patients in the human testing phase are shown in the following. Use this information to construct a $95 \%$ confidence interval for $\mu$, the mean increase in blood pressure associated with the new drug for all patients in the population.

\begin{array}{llllll}
1.7 & 3.0 & 0.8 & 3.4 & 2.7 & 2.1
\end{array}


```{r}
x <- c(1.7, 3.0, 0.8, 3.4, 2.7, 2.1)
mean(x) # x.bar, sample mean
sd(x)   #s, sample standard deviation
qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 6 - 1) # t_alpha/2 for df = n - 1
```

## Calculation of P-Value {.font80}

::: cle7
- **When $n<30$** and $\sigma$ is unknown:
  - **Use Case**: If the population is approximately normally distributed.
  - **Student's t-Statistic**:
    $$
    t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{0}}{s / \sqrt{n}}
    $$
    - Follows a $t$-distribution with $df = n - 1$.

> Example 2: Most water-treatment facilities monitor the quality of their drinking water on an hourly basis. One variable monitored is pH , which measures the degree of alkalinity or acidity in the water. A pH below 7.0 is acidic, one above 7.0 is alkaline, and a pH of 7.0 is neutral. One water-treatment plant has a target pH of 8.5. (Most try to maintain a slightly alkaline level.) The mean and standard deviation of 1 hour's test results, based on 17 water samples at this plant, are $\bar{x}=8.42$ and $s=0.16$. Does this sample provide sufficient evidence that the mean pH level in the water differs from 8.5 ? Perform the hypothesis test with $\alpha = 0.05$.

```{r}
qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 17 -1)  # critical value for t_alpha/2, df = n-1
```
