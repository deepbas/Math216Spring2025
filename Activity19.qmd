## Activity 1: Quiz

- **Question:** Given a sample mean $\bar{x} = 5.2$, a population standard deviation $\sigma = 2.5$, and a sample size $n = 100$, calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$.

- **Task:** Use the following R-code output to calculate the sample mean and standard deviation, then infer the shape, mean, and spread of the population and sampling distribution.

## Activity 3: Understanding Confidence Intervals


![Confidence Intervals](images/Day19-5.png){ width=50% }

![100(1-$\alpha$) CI](images/Day19-6.png){ width=100% }

![90% CI](images/Day19-7.png){ width=100% }



What is the correct interpretation of $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence intervals for a mean of a population?

## Activity 4: Group Activities with Real Data

- **Task:** Using the provided dataset in Activity 2, calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$. Interpret the results in the context of the problem.

## Activity 5: Case Studies and Problem-Solving

- **Case Study:** A hospital wants to estimate the average length of stay for its patients. They have collected data from 30 patients and found a sample mean of 5 days with a standard deviation of 5 days. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average length of stay and interpret the results. Use the interval estimator $\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \sigma_{\bar{x}}$ to calculate a confidence interval for the target parameter, $\mu$.
