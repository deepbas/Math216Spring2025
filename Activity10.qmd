## Activity 1: Ecological Research

**Scenario**: Weekly sightings of blue whales are recorded, with an average of 2.6 sightings.

**a.** Find the mean and standard deviation.

<br>



**b.** Probability of exactly five sightings:

<br>


**c.** Probability of fewer than two sightings:

<br>


## Activity 2: Quiz

**Question**: Given $\lambda = 4$, what is the probability of observing exactly 2 events?

**Options**:

- A) $0.1465$
- B) $0.1954$
- C) $0.2381$
- D) $0.2707$


## Activity 3: Interactive Data Exploration

**Task**: Use the `dpois` function to calculate the probability of observing exactly 3 events for different values of $\lambda$ (e.g., $\lambda = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$). Plot the results using `ggplot2`.

**R Code Example**:

```{webr}
lambda_values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
probabilities <- dpois(3, lambda = lambda_values)
data <- data.frame(lambda = lambda_values, probability = probabilities)
ggplot(data, aes(x = lambda, y = probability)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Probability of Observing Exactly 3 Events",
       x = "Lambda",
       y = "Probability")
```


## Activity 4: Group Activities with Real Data

**Task**: In a group, analyze a dataset given below of monthly traffic accidents at a busy intersection. The dataset includes the number of accidents per month over a year. Groups should:

1. Calculate the mean number of accidents per month.

2. Use the Poisson distribution to calculate the probability of observing exactly 5 accidents in a month.

3. Create a histogram of the observed data and overlay the Poisson distribution with the calculated $\lambda$.

**Dataset Example**:

```{webr}
set.seed(42)
accidents <- rpois(100, lambda = 3)  

lambda <- mean(accidents)
accidents_df <- data.frame(accidents)

# Calculate Poisson probabilities for each unique accident count
x_values <- min(accidents):max(accidents)
poisson_probs <- dpois(x_values, lambda)
poisson_df <- data.frame(accidents = x_values, density = poisson_probs)

# Create a histogram and overlay Poisson distribution
ggplot(accidents_df, aes(x = accidents)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 10, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_point(data = poisson_df, aes(x = accidents, y = density), color = "red", size = 2) +
  geom_line(data = poisson_df, aes(x = accidents, y = density), color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Traffic Accidents Histogram with Poisson Overlay",
       x = "Number of Accidents", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()
```
