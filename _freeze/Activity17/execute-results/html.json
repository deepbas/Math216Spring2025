The population mean and standard deviation are 50 and 10, resp.\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n# Generate population data (replace with your dataset)\nset.seed(123)\npopulation <- rnorm(1000, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsample_sizes <- c(11, 30, 50)\nnum_sims <- 1000\n\n# Generate sampling distributions\nsim_data <- map_dfr(sample_sizes, ~{\n  means <- replicate(num_sims, mean(sample(population, .x, replace = TRUE)))\n  data.frame(n = .x, means = means)\n})\n\nsim_data %>% \n  group_by(n) %>% \n  summarise(mean = mean(means),\n            SE = sd(means)) %>% \n  knitr::kable(caption = \"Mean and SE for different sample sizes\")\n\n# Theoretical normal curves\nx_seq <- seq(min(sim_data$means), max(sim_data$means), length.out = 100)\nnorm_curves <- map_dfr(sample_sizes, ~{\n  data.frame(\n    n = .x,\n    x = x_seq,\n    y = dnorm(x_seq, mean = mean(population), sd = sd(population)/sqrt(.x))\n  )\n})\n\n# Create density plot with normal curve overlay\nggplot(sim_data, aes(x = means)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 30, \n                 fill = \"skyblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_line(data = norm_curves, aes(x = x, y = y), \n            color = \"red\", linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~n, scales = \"free_x\", ncol =1) +\n  labs(title = \"Sampling Distributions\",\n       subtitle = \"Red curve shows theoretical normal distribution\",\n       x = \"Sample Mean\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n:::\n\n\n  1. Verify the sample means for different sample sizes (e.g., $n=11$, $n=30$, $n=50$).\n  \n  \n  2. Verify the standard errors calculations and comment on the shape of the sampling distributions.\n\n\n### Activity 3: Case Studies and Problem-Solving\n\n**Case Study**: A manufacturing company produces steel sheets with a target thickness of 175 mm. Due to machine variability, the thickness is uniformly distributed between 150 and 200 mm. The quality control team takes random samples of 36 sheets to monitor the process.\n\n- **Question**: What is the probability that the sample mean thickness is greater than 180 mm?\n\n\n### Activity 4: Sampling Distribution\n\n**Prompt**: Suppose we have selected a random sample of $n=36$ observations from a population with mean $\\mu=80$ and standard deviation $\\sigma=6$.\n\na. What is the value of the mean $\\mu_{\\bar{x}}$ and standard deviation (standard error) $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}$ of the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\\bar{x}$?\n\nb. What is the probability that the sample mean is greater than 82?\n\n### Activity 5: Sampling Distribution of Age\n\n**Prompt**: Based on data from the U.S. Census, the mean age of college students in 2011 was $\\mu=25$ years, with a standard deviation of $\\sigma=9.5$ years.\n\na. Describe the sampling distribution of the mean of a sample of 125 students.\n\nb. What is the probability that the sample mean age of the 125 students is greater than 26 years?\n\n\n### Activity 6: Sampling Distribution with Non-Normal Populations  \n\n**Question 1** (Exponential Distribution):  \n\nThe time between customer arrivals at a coffee shop follows an exponential distribution with a rate parameter $\\lambda = 0.2$ (mean $\\mu = 5$ minutes). If 50 arrival times are randomly sampled:  \na. What are the mean ($\\mu_{\\bar{x}}$) and standard error ($\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}$) of the sampling distribution?  \nb. What is the probability that the sample mean exceeds 6 minutes?  \n\n**Question 2** (Poisson Distribution):  \n\nA call center receives an average of 12 calls per hour (Poisson-distributed). Suppose 100 hourly call counts are sampled:  \na. Describe the sampling distribution of the sample mean.  \nb. Calculate the probability that the sample mean is less than 11.5 calls.  \n\n\n\n\n",
