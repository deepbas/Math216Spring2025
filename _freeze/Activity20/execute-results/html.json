They have a small sample of 6 patients with the following blood pressure increases (in points):\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nblood_pressure_increases <- c(1.7, 3.0, 0.8, 3.4, 2.7, 2.1)\n```\n:::\n\n- **Task:** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean increase in blood pressure. Discuss the assumptions required for this interval to be valid and whether they are reasonably satisfied.\n\n\\vspace*{1in}\n\n\n## Activity 6: Calculating Sample Size\n\nConsider a large hospital that wants to estimate the average length of stay of its patients, $\\mu$ . The hospital randomly samples $n=100$ of its patients and finds that the sample mean length of stay is $\\bar{x}=4.5$ days. Also, suppose it is known that the standard deviation of the length of stay for all hospital patients is $\\sigma=4$ days.\n\nInitial 95\\% C.I.: $4.5 \\pm 0.78$ days; width $=1.56$ days.\n\n**Adjusting Sample Size for Precision** \n\n- Goal: Narrow C.I. width from 1.56 days to 0.50 day.\n- Calculation leads to a required sample size of approximately ____ patients.\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n# Enter your code here ...\n\n```\n:::\n\n",
