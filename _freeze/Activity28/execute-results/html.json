Pairs are formed by choosing a male and a female with the same major and similar GPAs. The data is provided in the table below. Use $\\alpha=0.05$ to perform a hypothesis test to see if the data provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that \"the male average starting salary is greater than the female average starting salary.\"\n\n| Pair | Male | Female | Difference Male - Female |\n|------|------|--------|--------------------------|\n| 1    | 29,300 | 28,800 | 500 |\n| 2    | 41,500 | 41,600 | -100 |\n| 3    | 40,400 | 39,800 | 600 |\n| 4    | 38,500 | 38,500 | 0 |\n| 5    | 43,500 | 42,600 | 900 |\n| 6    | 37,800 | 38,000 | -200 |\n| 7    | 69,500 | 69,200 | 300 |\n| 8    | 41,200 | 40,100 | 1,100 |\n| 9    | 38,400 | 38,200 | 200 |\n| 10   | 59,200 | 58,500 | 700 |\n\n1. **Analyze**: Perform a paired t-test on the salary data.\n2. **Interpret**: Discuss the results, including the p-value and confidence interval.\n3. **Conclude**: Determine whether the data supports the claim that male graduates earn more than female graduates.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\ndiff <- c(500, -100, 600, 0, 900, -200, 300, 1100, 200, 700)\n# Perform the paired t-test\nt.test(diff, alternative = \"greater\")\n```\n:::\n\n## **Activity 3: Exam Improvement**\n\n\nA teacher gives a pre-test and post-test to 8 students. Did scores improve? Test with α=0.05.  \n\n**Data**:  \n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\npre <- c(65, 72, 58, 83, 90, 75, 62, 68)\npost <- c(72, 75, 65, 88, 92, 82, 70, 73)\n```\n:::\n\n\n1. Run the paired t-test:  \n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nt.test(post, pre, paired=TRUE, alternative=\"greater\")\n```\n:::\n2. Report the p-value. Is the improvement significant?  \n\n\n\n## **Activity 4: Drug Effectiveness**\n\n\nA drug claims to reduce blood pressure. Test with α=0.05 using this data from 6 patients (mmHg):  \n\n**Data**:  \n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nbefore <- c(140, 155, 132, 148, 160, 135)\nafter <- c(132, 145, 130, 140, 152, 128)\n```\n:::\n\n**Steps**:  \n\n1. Verify normality of differences:  \n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\ndifferences <- before - after\nshapiro.test(differences)  \n```\n:::\n\n2. Run the test:  \n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nt.test(before, after, paired=TRUE, alternative=\"greater\")\n```\n:::\n\n3. **Output**:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
