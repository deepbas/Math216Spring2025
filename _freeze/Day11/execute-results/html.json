Unlike discrete variables, which deal with countable outcomes, continuous variables are described by smooth curves called **Probability Density Functions (PDFs)**.\n\n- **Key Features of PDFs**:\n  - **Area as Probability**: The probability that $X$ falls between $a$ and $b$ is the area under the PDF curve between these points.\n  - **Non-negativity**: $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$.\n  - **Total Probability**: The integral of $f(x)$ over its entire range equals 1, representing certainty.\n  - **Zero Probability at a Point**: For continuous variables, $P(X = a) = 0$ for any specific value $a$. Probabilities are only meaningful over intervals.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Visualizing Continuous Distributions\n\n::: row\n::: left\n\n![](images/continuous_pdf.png)\n\n:::\n\n::: right\n\n::: font60\n::: cle6\n\n- **Interpreting the Curve**:  \n  The shape of the PDF reflects how probabilities are distributed. A tall, narrow peak indicates values are concentrated around a specific point, while a flat curve suggests more variability.\n\n- **Calculating Probabilities**:  \n  To find $P(a \\leq X \\leq b)$, compute the area under the curve between $a$ and $b$. This is the essence of continuous probability!\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The Uniform Distribution: Simplicity with Power\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Definition\"}\n\nThe **uniform distribution** models scenarios where every outcome in a range is equally likely. It’s the simplest continuous distribution, yet it’s incredibly useful in practice.\n\n- **PDF**: $f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}$ for $x \\in [a, b]$.\n- **Graphical Representation**: A flat rectangle, reflecting equal probability density across the range.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Visualizing and Calculating Probabilities {.font80}\n\n::: row\n::: left\n\n![](images/uniform_pdf.png)\n\n:::\n\n::: right\n\nWhy Use the Uniform Distribution?\n\n::: font80\n::: cle11\n\n- **Equal Likelihood**:  \n  It’s ideal for modeling fair processes, such as random number generation or selecting a random time within a fixed interval.\n\n- **Easy Calculations**:  \n  Probabilities are straightforward to compute. For example, $P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = (b-c) \\times \\frac{1}{d-c}$.\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Statistical Measures of $Unif(a,b)$\n\n::: font80\n::: cle13\n\n- **Mean and Median**:  \n  Both are located at the center of the interval: $\\mu = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n\n- **Variance**:  \n  The spread of the distribution is $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$. A wider range leads to greater variability.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## \n\n::: font60\n\n> Example 1: An unprincipled used-car dealer sells a car to an unsuspecting buyer, even though the dealer knows that the car will have a major breakdown within the next 6 months. The dealer provides a warranty of 45 days on all cars sold. Let $x$ represent the length of time until the breakdown occurs. Assume that x is a uniform random variable with values between 0 and 6 months.\n\na. Calculate and interpret the mean and standard deviation of $X$.\n\n:::\n\n##\n\n::: font60\n\nb. Graph the probability distribution of $X$ , and show the mean on the horizontal axis. Also show one and two-standard-deviation intervals around the mean.\n\n::: custom-space\n:::\n\nc. Calculate the probability that the breakdown occurs while the car is still under warranty.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## The Normal Distribution {.font80}\n\n\n::: cle2\n::: font80\n\nThe Normal Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical around its mean, represented by $\\mu$. This distribution is crucial in statistics and is often used to represent real-world variables.\n\n$$\nf(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\n\n- $\\mu=$ Mean (average, expected value)\n- $\\sigma=$ Standard deviation\n- $\\pi \\approx 3.141592653589$\n- $e \\approx 2.71828$\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Applications of the Normal Distribution {.font80}\n\n\n::: cle10\n::: font80\n\nMany real-world phenomena are well approximated by the normal distribution. For example:\n\n- Measurement errors, e.g., blood pressure readings.\n- Yearly rainfall amounts in certain regions.\n\nThese applications underscore the normal distribution's role in statistical inference and various practical scenarios.\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Applications of the Normal Distribution {.font80}\n\n\n::: cle9\n::: font80\n\nTo determine if data approximates a normal distribution, one can compare the sample's frequency distribution against the theoretical normal curve:\n\n- Graphical methods: Q-Q plots, histograms.\n- Statistical tests: Shapiro-Wilk test, Anderson-Darling test.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Standard Normal Distribution {.font80}\n\n\n::: cle7\n::: font80\n\nA special case of the normal distribution is the standard normal distribution, where $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma=1$. It is used extensively to simplify problems in statistics.\n\n$$\nf(z)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} z^2\\right)\n$$\n\n- Denoted as $Z$ for a standard normal variable.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Standard Normal Distribution {.font70}\n\n\n::: cle13\n::: font80\n\nThe probability that a normal random variable falls between two values is the area under the curve between those values. This area can be computed using:\n\n- Z-tables for the standard normal distribution.\n- Software functions, e.g., `pnorm` in R \n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Day11_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
