Use $z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.645$.\n\n\\vspace*{1in}\n\n## Activity 2: Case Studies and Problem-Solving\n\n- **Scenario:** A political campaign wants to estimate the proportion of voters who support their candidate. They survey 500 voters and find that 300 support the candidate.\n- **Task:** Apply the concepts learned to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of supporters. Discuss the implications of the confidence interval width on the campaign's strategy.\n\n\\vspace*{1in}\n\n\n## Activity 3: Sample Size Calulations\n\nBuilding on the information and context from Activity 1, design a study where the goal is to calculate the required sample size to achieve a narrower margin of error for the population proportion $p$. Assume a desired sampling error of 0.03 at a $90 \\%$ confidence level, maintaining the same population proportion estimate $(\\hat{p}=0.65)$. How many individuals should be included in the new sample to meet these precision requirements? If you did not know $p$ in advance, how would you estimate the sample size in advance for the same sampling error?\n\n\\vspace*{1in}\n\n\n## Activity 4: Sample Size Calulations\n\nUsing the setup of Activity 1, find the sample size needed for a SE of 0.01?\n\n![](images/Day21-8.png) \n\n\n\n",
