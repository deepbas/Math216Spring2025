This dataset is commonly used in statistics education to explore relationships between socioeconomic factors and test scores.\n\n**Key Variables**:\n\n- `ID`: Student identifier (unique number)\n- `Gender`: Self-reported gender (Male/Female)\n- `Race`: Ethnicity (White/Black/Asian/Other)\n- `SES`: Socioeconomic status (Low/Middle/High)\n- `Program`: Enrollment track (General/Vocational/Academic)\n- `Reading`, `Math`, `Science`: Standardized test scores (0-100)\n\n## Data Preview\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nhsb2 %>%\n  head() %>%\n  kable(format = \"html\", caption = \"First 6 observations from hsb2 dataset\")\n```\n:::\n\n## Questions\n\n### 1. Variable Classification  \n\nClassify these variables as **qualitative** (categorical) or **quantitative** (numerical): \n\n- Gender  \n- Math Score  \n- SES (Socioeconomic Status)  \n- Program  \n- Science Score  \n\n*For two of your choices, explain why they belong to that category.*  \n\n\\vspace*{0.5in}\n\n\n### 2. Gender Variable Manipulation  \n\nSuppose researchers want to analyze gender differences in math performance: \n\n- What is the *current variable type* of `Gender`?  \n\n- How could you convert `Gender` to a numeric format? What values would you assign? \n\n\\vspace*{0.5in}\n\n\n### 3. Critical Thinking  \n\nIf `Gender` is coded as 0 (Male) and 1 (Female):  \n\n- Could you calculate an \"average gender\"? Explain why this is or isnâ€™t meaningful.  \n\n\\vspace*{0.5in}\n\n\n- Why might statisticians prefer to keep `Gender` as a categorical variable?  \n\n",
