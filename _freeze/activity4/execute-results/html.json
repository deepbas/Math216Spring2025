Think-Pair-Share**\n\n1. **Think:** Take 2 minutes to identify a real-world example of a symmetric distribution (e.g., heights of people, test scores). Write down your example. \n\n2. **Pair:** Turn to a partner and discuss your examples. Compare and contrast the examples you both came up with.  \n\n3. **Share:** Be prepared to share your findings with the class. Highlight why your example fits the concept of a symmetric distribution.  \n\n\\vspace*{1in}\n\n### **2. Quiz**\n\nAnswer the following question individually: \n\n- \"If a student's GPA has a z-score of 2, what does this mean?\"  \n\n  - (a) The GPA is 2 points above the mean.  \n  - (b) The GPA is 2 standard deviations above the mean.  \n  - (c) The GPA is 2 standard deviations below the mean.  \n  - (d) The GPA is 2 points below the mean.  \n\n**Discussion:** After answering, discuss with a partner why you chose your answer. Be ready to explain your reasoning to the class.  \n\n\\vspace*{1in}\n\n\n### **3. Case Studies and Problem-Solving**\n\n1. **Case Study:** Use the graphical and numerical summaries of **Student Survey Dataset** to compare the GPA of students for different Year.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Activity4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Summary Statistics of GPA for all Years\n\n|Year      |     mean|        sd|   n|\n|:---------|--------:|---------:|---:|\n|FirstYear | 3.070759| 0.4702584|  79|\n|Junior    | 3.273636| 0.3688057|  33|\n|Senior    | 3.171667| 0.3754274|  36|\n|Sophomore | 3.173224| 0.3690737| 183|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n2. **Tasks:**  \n\n   - Interpret the results: Do Junior Students have higher GPAs on average? What might explain this result?  \n   - Discuss potential biases or limitations in the dataset.  \n\n\n3. **Reflect:** Write a short paragraph summarizing your findings and share it with the class.  \n\n\n",
