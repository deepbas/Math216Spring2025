The dealer provides a warranty of 45 days on all cars sold. Let $x$ represent the length of time until the breakdown occurs. Assume that x is a uniform random variable with values between 0 and 6 months.\n\na. Calculate and interpret the mean and standard deviation of $X$.\n\n\\vspace*{0.5in}\n\n\nb. Graph the probability distribution of $X$ , and show the mean on the horizontal axis. Also show one and two-standard-deviation intervals around the mean.\n\n\\vspace*{0.5in}\n\n\nc. Calculate the probability that the breakdown occurs while the car is still under warranty.\n\n\n\n\n",
