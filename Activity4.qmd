### **1. Think-Pair-Share**

1. **Think:** Take 2 minutes to identify a real-world example of a symmetric distribution (e.g., heights of people, test scores). Write down your example. 

2. **Pair:** Turn to a partner and discuss your examples. Compare and contrast the examples you both came up with.  

3. **Share:** Be prepared to share your findings with the class. Highlight why your example fits the concept of a symmetric distribution.

### **2. Quiz**

Answer the following question individually: 

- "If a student's GPA has a z-score of 2, what does this mean?"  

  - (a) The GPA is 2 points above the mean.  
  - (b) The GPA is 2 standard deviations above the mean.  
  - (c) The GPA is 2 standard deviations below the mean.  
  - (d) The GPA is 2 points below the mean.  

**Discussion:** After answering, discuss with a partner why you chose your answer. Be ready to explain your reasoning to the class.

### **3. Case Studies and Problem-Solving**

1. **Case Study:** Use the graphical and numerical summaries of **Student Survey Dataset** to compare the GPA of students for different Year.  

```{webr}
survey <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/StudentSurvey.csv") %>% 
  tidyr::drop_na()

ggplot(survey, aes(x=GPA, fill=Year)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~Year) 

survey %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(GPA),
            sd = sd(GPA),
            n = n()) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Summary Statistics of GPA for all Years")
```  

2. **Tasks:**  

   - Interpret the results: Do Junior Students have higher GPAs on average? What might explain this result?  
   - Discuss potential biases or limitations in the dataset.  


3. **Reflect:** Write a short paragraph summarizing your findings and share it with the class.
