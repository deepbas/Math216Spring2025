This course will provide you with a solid foundation in statistical theory while taking you on a journey through the practical aspects of the subject. Along the way, you’ll gain experience with statistical software, learn to interpret and effectively communicate statistical findings, and explore a range of topics in descriptive and inferential data analysis and both parametric and non-parametric statistical inference. Some of the areas we’ll delve into include probability, normal distribution, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and simple linear regression.\nAt the heart of this course is the ability to interpret results and grasp underlying concepts, rather than merely obtaining numerical outcomes. By engaging with a diverse set of problems, you’ll become well-versed in statistical methodologies. However, it’s crucial to remember that a deep understanding of the concepts is the key to drawing meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nMaster the basic principles of data analysis, including the production and application of data in studies and experiments.\nApply principles of inference to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests effectively.\nCritically evaluate statistical arguments and methodologies in published research.\nCompare and differentiate between parametric and non-parametric methods in statistical analysis.\nUtilize software R to conduct data analysis, create graphs, and perform basic statistical tests."
