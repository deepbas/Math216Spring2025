This course will provide you with a solid foundation in statistical theory while taking you on a journey through the practical aspects of the subject. Along the way, you’ll gain experience with statistical software, learn to interpret and effectively communicate statistical findings, and explore a range of topics in descriptive and inferential data analysis and both parametric and non-parametric statistical inference. Some of the areas we’ll delve into include probability, normal distribution, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and simple linear regression.\nAt the heart of this course is the ability to interpret results and grasp underlying concepts, rather than merely obtaining numerical outcomes. By engaging with a diverse set of problems, you’ll become well-versed in statistical methodologies. However, it’s crucial to remember that a deep understanding of the concepts is the key to drawing meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nMaster the basic principles of data analysis, including the production and application of data in studies and experiments.\nApply principles of inference to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests effectively.\nCritically evaluate statistical arguments and methodologies in published research.\nCompare and differentiate between parametric and non-parametric methods in statistical analysis.\nUtilize software R to conduct data analysis, create graphs, and perform basic statistical tests."

    "text": "R Code Chunk Options\nBefore diving into data loading, let’s understand important R chunk options:\n\n\neval: Use eval=FALSE to prevent code from running but still display it.\n\necho: With echo=FALSE, the code is run but not displayed in the document.\n\ninclude: include=FALSE runs the code and hides both the code and output from the final output.\n\nExample to demonstrate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# This code will run, and both code and output will appear in the document.\nsummary(cars)\n\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n\n\nSetting the Working Directory\nIt’s crucial to set the working directory in R to the folder where your course files are stored. This can be done in several ways:\n\n\nUsing RStudio:\n\nIn RStudio, you can set the working directory through the menu by navigating to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory... and selecting your math216 folder.\n\n\n\nUsing R Script:\n\nYou can also set the working directory directly in an R script using the setwd() function. Place the following line of code at the beginning of your script:\n\nsetwd(\"~/math216\")\nReplace \"~/math216\" with the actual path to your course folder.\n\n\nUsing R Console:\n\nYou can manually set the working directory in the R console with the same command:\n\nsetwd(\"~/math216\")"
