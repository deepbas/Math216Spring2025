This can be done in several ways:\n\n\nUsing RStudio:\n\nIn RStudio, you can set the working directory through the menu by navigating to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory... and selecting your math216 folder.\n\n\n\nUsing R Script:\n\nYou can also set the working directory directly in an R script using the setwd() function. Place the following line of code at the beginning of your script:\n\nsetwd(\"~/math216\")\nReplace \"~/math216\" with the actual path to your course folder.\n\n\nUsing R Console:\n\nYou can manually set the working directory in the R console with the same command:\n\nsetwd(\"~/math216\")",

    "text": "Challenges with Small Samples\n\n\nNormality Assumption: For samples smaller than 30, the distribution of the population must be approximately normal for the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) to be considered normally distributed. For example, if you’re studying the heights of a rare species of plant, and can only find a few samples, the underlying distribution of these heights must be normal for standard approaches to work.\nStandard Deviation Issues: When using the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) in place of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), the estimate becomes less reliable with smaller samples. Consider a scenario where you measure the amount of a chemical in water samples from different locations. With only a few samples, the variability in your measurements could significantly affect the reliability of your estimates, leading to potentially misleading conclusions.",
