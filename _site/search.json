This session introduces the student’s t-statistic, a better-suited approach for such scenarios."

    "text": "Challenges with Small Samples\n\n\nNormality Assumption: For samples smaller than 30, the distribution of the population must be approximately normal for the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) to be considered normally distributed. For example, if you’re studying the heights of a rare species of plant, and can only find a few samples, the underlying distribution of these heights must be normal for standard approaches to work.\nStandard Deviation Issues: When using the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) in place of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), the estimate becomes less reliable with smaller samples. Consider a scenario where you measure the amount of a chemical in water samples from different locations. With only a few samples, the variability in your measurements could significantly affect the reliability of your estimates, leading to potentially misleading conclusions."

    "text": "Welcome to the captivating world of statistical thinking! This course will provide you with a solid foundation in statistical theory while taking you on a journey through the practical aspects of the subject. Along the way, you’ll gain experience with statistical software, learn to interpret and effectively communicate statistical findings, and explore a range of topics in descriptive and inferential data analysis and both parametric and non-parametric statistical inference. Some of the areas we’ll delve into include probability, normal distribution, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and simple linear regression.\nAt the heart of this course is the ability to interpret results and grasp underlying concepts, rather than merely obtaining numerical outcomes. By engaging with a diverse set of problems, you’ll become well-versed in statistical methodologies. However, it’s crucial to remember that a deep understanding of the concepts is the key to drawing meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nMaster the basic principles of data analysis, including the production and application of data in studies and experiments.\nApply principles of inference to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests effectively.\nCritically evaluate statistical arguments and methodologies in published research.\nCompare and differentiate between parametric and non-parametric methods in statistical analysis.\nUtilize software R to conduct data analysis, create graphs, and perform basic statistical tests."

    "text": "2. Case Studies and Problem-Solving\nTo develop programs for business travelers staying at convention hotels, Hyatt Hotels Corp. commissioned a study of executives who play golf. The study revealed that \\(55 \\%\\) of the executives admitted that they had cheated at golf. Also, \\(20 \\%\\) of the executives admitted that they had cheated at golf, and had lied in business. Given that an executive had cheated at golf, what is the probability that the executive also had lied in business?\n\nCalculate the conditional probability that an executive lied in business given they cheated at golf.\n\nDiscuss the ethical implications of the findings.\n\nPropose strategies for businesses to address such ethical dilemmas.\n\n\n\n\\(P(\\text{Cheated at golf}) = 0.55\\)\n\n\\(P(\\text{Cheated at golf and lied in business}) = 0.20\\)\n\nGiven that an executive cheated at golf, what is the probability that they also lied in business?\n3. Cigarette smoking and cancer\nMany medical researchers have conducted experiments to examine the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer. Consider an individual randomly selected from the adult male population. Let \\(A\\) represent the event that the individual smokes, and let \\(A^c\\) denote the complement of \\(A\\) (the event that the individual does not smoke). Similarly, let \\(B\\) represent the event that the individual develops cancer, and let \\(B^c\\) be the complement of that event. Then the four sample points associated with the experiment are shown in the following figure, and their probabilities for a certain section of the United States are given in the table (Refer to the sides). Use these sample point probabilities to examine the relationship between smoking and cancer.\n\nGiven a person is a smoker, what is the probability of having cancer?\n\n\n\nGiven a person is a smoker, what is the probability of not having cancer?\n\n\n\nGiven a person is not a smoker, what is the probability of having cancer?\n\n\n\nGiven a person is not a smoker, what is the probability of not having cancer?"
