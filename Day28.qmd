## Comparing Two Population Means: Paired Difference Example {.font80}

::: cle1

- **Objective**: Assess the effectiveness of two training programs in skill enhancement.
- **Design Rationale**: Participants are paired based on initial assessments to ensure comparable skill levels, enhancing the validity of the comparison.

:::



## Conceptual Foundation for Paired Samples {.font80}

::: cle2

- Paired designs minimize variability by controlling for individual differences.
- This approach is crucial in settings where participants have inherent variability in initial abilities.

:::



## Hypotheses Framework {.font80}

::: cle3

- **Null Hypothesis** $(H_0)$: $\mu_{\text{A}} = \mu_{\text{B}}$ (no difference in means between two methods).
- **Alternative Hypothesis** $(H_a)$: $\mu_{\text{A}} > \mu_{\text{B}}$ (Method A outperforms Method B).

## Transition to Paired Analysis {.font80}

::: cle5

- Transition from single-sample to paired-sample testing involves considering the dependency between paired observations.
- Independence within pairs is crucial; the pairing itself should not influence the measured outcomes.

:::


## Statistical Techniques and Conditions {.font80}

::: cle6

### Known vs. Unknown Standard Deviations

- Use $z$-tests when standard deviations are known and sample sizes are large.
- Employ $t$-tests when standard deviations are unknown and sample sizes are small.

### Normality and Non-Normal Data

- For normally distributed differences, use $t$-tests.
- For non-normal data, consider non-parametric tests like the Sign Test or Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test.

:::


## Selecting Appropriate Statistical Tests {.font80}

::: cle7

- **For Normal Distributions**: Apply the paired $t$-test.
- **For Non-Normal Distributions**: Use non-parametric methods that do not assume a normal distribution.

:::



## Results Interpretation and Confidence Intervals {.font80}

::: cle8

- Evaluate the p-value against the significance level to decide on rejecting the null hypothesis.
- Construct confidence intervals to estimate the range of true effect sizes, enhancing understanding of practical significance.

## Diagnostic Plots and R Code {.font80}

::: panel-tabset

### Diagnostic Plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)

# Define the scores for Method A and Method B
methodA <- c(85, 88, 90, 92, 91, 89, 93, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107)
methodB <- c(83, 89, 87, 84, 92, 90, 85, 91, 98, 94, 100, 101, 99, 111, 111, 106, 109, 103, 111, 114)

# Calculate differences
differences <- methodA - methodB

# Generate a QQ plot for normality check
qq_norm <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(differences), aes(sample = differences)) +
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("QQ Plot of Differences")

# Generate a histogram for normality check
histogram <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(differences), aes(x = differences)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = "maroon", fill = "gold") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Differences")

grid.arrange(qq_norm, histogram, ncol = 2)
```

### R Code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Perform the Anderson-Darling test for normality
library(nortest)
ad.test(differences)

# Perform the paired t-test
t.test(methodA, methodB, paired = TRUE, alternative = "greater")

# Calculate standard deviation of differences
sd(differences) # s_d

# Calculate critical value for t-distribution
qt(0.975, df = 20 - 1) # critical value
```

> Example 1: An experiment is conducted to compare the starting salaries of male and female college graduates who find jobs. Pairs are formed by choosing a male and a female with the same major and similar grade point averages (GPAs). Suppose a random sample of 10 pairs is formed in this manner and the starting annual salary of each person is recorded. The results are shown in following table. Use $\alpha=0.05$, perform hypothesis test to see if the data provide sufficient evidence to support "the male average starting salary is greater than female average starting salary".

| Table 9.5 | Data on Annual Salaries for Matched Pairs of College <br> Graduates |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Pair | Male | Female | Difference Male - Female |
| 1 | $\$ 29,300$ | $\$ 28,800$ | $\$ 500$ |
| 2 | 41,500 | 41,600 | -100 |
| 3 | 40,400 | 39,800 | 600 |
| 4 | 38,500 | 38,500 | 0 |
| 5 | 43,500 | 42,600 | 900 |
| 6 | 37,800 | 38,000 | -200 |
| 7 | 69,500 | 69,200 | 300 |
| 8 | 41,200 | 40,100 | 1,100 |
| 9 | 38,400 | 38,200 | 200 |
| 10 | 59,200 | 58,500 | 700 |
