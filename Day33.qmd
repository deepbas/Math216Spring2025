## Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis {.font80}

::: cle6
- **Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data**: Transition from numerical to categorical data, which includes discrete categories like opinions or health status.
- **Examples**: Opinions range from Excellent to Poor; Health Status is either Sick or Healthy; Vaccination Status can be Yes or No.
- **Data Presentation**: Often shown in tables counting occurrences across categories.

## Categorical Data Representation{.font60}

Table 1: Opinions on Pricing

| Category             | Observed |
|----------------------|----------|
| Pay much more        | 218      |
| Pay somewhat more    | 497      |
| Pay the same         | 425      |
| Pay less             | 15       |

## Hypothesis Setup {.font80}

::: cle12
- **Scenario**: Evaluating gender distribution in a university STEM program against a regional expectation of a 50:50 male-to-female ratio.
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: $p_f = p_m = \frac{1}{2}$
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: $p_f \neq p_m$
:::

## Data Overview {.font80}

::: cle7
- **Total Students**: 500 (200 female, 300 male)
- **Expected under $H_0$**: Each gender = $500 \times \frac{1}{2} = 250$
:::

## Chi-Square Test Statistic {.font80}

::: cle12
- **Test Statistic ($T$)**: A test statistic is one number, computed from the data, which we can use to assess the null hypothesis. Measures divergence of observed counts from expected counts under $H_0$.
- **Calculation**: Sum of the squared differences between observed and expected counts, normalized by expected counts.

\begin{aligned}
\chi^2 = \sum{\frac{(observed - expected)^2}{expected}} = \sum{\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}}
\end{aligned}

## Chi-Square Test Table {.font80}


\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \textbf{Category} & \hat{p}_j & \textbf{Expected, } E_j & \textbf{Observed, } O_j \\
\hline \text{Female} & \frac{1}{2} & 250 & 200 \\
\hline \text{Male} & \frac{1}{2} & 250 & 300 \\
\hline
\end{array}


## Chi-Square Test Data Table {.font60}

::: cle12
- This table displays the categorical distribution of data for hypothesis testing.
  - **$j$**: Category index
  - **Category**: Description of each category
  - **$\hat{p}_j$**: Estimated proportion for each category
  - **Expected, $E_j$**: Expected count under null hypothesis = $n \hat{p}_j$
  - **Observed, $O_j$**: Observed count in sample

| $j$ | Category | $\hat{p}_j$ | Expected, $E_j$ | Observed, $O_j$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | $\mathbf{C 1}$ | $\hat{p}_1$ | $n \hat{p}_1$ | $n_1$ |
| 2 | $\mathbf{C 2}$ | $\hat{p}_2$ | $n \hat{p}_2$ | $n_2$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| $k$ | $\mathbf{C k}$ | $\hat{p}_k$ | $n \hat{p}_k$ | $n_k$ |

## Summary of the Steps {.font80}

::: cle12
- State Hypothesis
- Calculate a test statistic, based on your sample data
- Create a distribution of this statistic, as it would be observed if the null hypothesis were true
- Measure how extreme your test statistic is, as compared to the distribution generated under null
- **Decision**: Reject or fail to reject $H_0$ based on the Chi-Square test value compared to critical values from Chi-Square distribution tables.
- **Implication**: Determines if there is a statistically significant difference in gender distribution compared to regional expectations.

## Example: Testing the Fairness of a Die {.font80}

::: cle7

| Outcome (Category) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Observed | 12 | 7 | 14 | 15 | 4 | 8 |


- **Objective**: Test whether the outcome of die rolls matches a fair die's expected distribution.
- **Method**: Use the Chi-Square test to compare observed outcomes against the expected frequencies for a fair die.
:::

## Testing the Fairness of a Die: R-code {.font80}

::: cle2
```{r}
# Assuming the die is fair, each of the 6 sides should appear with equal probability.
observed_counts <- c(12, 7, 14, 15, 4, 8)
expected_probabilities <- rep(1/6, 6)
chisq.test(x=observed_counts, p=expected_probabilities)
```

- **Expected:** Each side of the die should appear 10 times out of 60 rolls under the assumption of fairness.
- **Analysis:** Perform the Chi-Square test and review the p-value to determine if there is significant evidence to reject the fairness assumption
:::


## {.font50}

> Example1: In a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, 85 rounds are played resulting in the following counts for each outcome:

| Category  | Observed |
|-----------|----------|
| Rock      | 36       |
| Paper     | 12       |
| Scissors  | 37       |

The expected frequency for each category under the assumption of equal likelihood is 28.33. Using a Chi-Square test, determine if the observed frequencies significantly differ from what is expected at a 0.05 significance level.

> Example 2: A poll conducted by the General Social Survey asked 1155 people whether they thought that people with high incomes should pay a greater or smaller percentage of their income in tax than low-income people. The results are presented in the following table.

| Category | Observed |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pay much more | 218 |
| Pay somewhat more | 497 |
| Pay the same | 425 |
| Pay less | 15 |

Five years earlier, it was determined that $18.5 \%$ believed that the rich should pay much more, $39.2 \%$ believed they should pay somewhat more, $41.2 \%$ believed they should pay the same, and $1.1 \%$ believed they should pay less. Can we conclude that the current percentages differ from these? Use $\alpha=0.05$ level of significance.
