## Activity 1: Think-Pair-Share


$$
T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$


1. **Think** individually about why the t-statistic is more appropriate for small samples compared to the z-statistic.
2. **Pair** with a neighbor to discuss their thoughts.
3. **Share** your insights with the class.

## Activity 2: Quiz


- **Question:** Given a sample mean $\bar{x} = 2.283$, sample standard deviation $s = 0.950$, and sample size $n = 6$, calculate the t-statistic for a population mean $\mu = 2.0$.

## Activity 3: Interactive Data Exploration

**Prompt:** Provide students with the following dataset and ask them to explore it using RStudio:

```{webr}
blood_pressure <- c(1.7, 3.0, 0.8, 3.4, 2.7, 2.1)
```

- **Task:** Calculate the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and sample standard deviation $s$.
- **Visualization:** Create a histogram of the data and overlay a normal distribution curve.

## Activity 4: Group Activities with Real Data

- **Dataset:** 

```{webr}
printhead_failures <- c(1.14, 1.23, 1.32, 1.21, 1.25, 1.28, 1.31, 1.22, 
                        1.26, 1.29, 1.33, 1.24, 1.27, 1.30, 1.34)
```

- **Task:** Calculate the 99% confidence interval for the mean number of characters printed before the printhead fails.
- **Interpretation:** Discuss the implications of the confidence interval in the context of the problem.

## Activity 5: Case Studies and Problem-Solving


- **Scenario:** A pharmaceutical company wants to estimate the mean increase in blood pressure for patients taking a new drug. They have a small sample of 6 patients with the following blood pressure increases (in points):

```{webr}
blood_pressure_increases <- c(1.7, 3.0, 0.8, 3.4, 2.7, 2.1)
```

- **Task:** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean increase in blood pressure. Discuss the assumptions required for this interval to be valid and whether they are reasonably satisfied.

## Activity 6: Calculating Sample Size

Consider a large hospital that wants to estimate the average length of stay of its patients, $\mu$ . The hospital randomly samples $n=100$ of its patients and finds that the sample mean length of stay is $\bar{x}=4.5$ days. Also, suppose it is known that the standard deviation of the length of stay for all hospital patients is $\sigma=4$ days.

Initial 95\% C.I.: $4.5 \pm 0.78$ days; width $=1.56$ days.

**Adjusting Sample Size for Precision** 

- Goal: Narrow C.I. width from 1.56 days to 0.50 day.
- Calculation leads to a required sample size of approximately ____ patients.
