#### **1. Think-Pair-Share Activity**

### Think-Pair-Share: Calculating Descriptive Statistics

1. **Think:** Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for the following dataset by hand:

   ```
   Pulse Rates: [68, 72, 70, 65, 74, 69, 71, 67, 73, 70]
   ```

2. **Pair:** Discuss your calculations with a partner. Compare your results and resolve any discrepancies.

3. **Share:** Share your findings with the class. Be prepared to explain your calculations.

#### **3. Case Studies and Problem-Solving**

**Objective:** Apply statistical concepts to solve real-world problems.


### Case Study: Health Data Analysis

1. **Scenario:** A health study collected data on smoking habits and pulse rates. The dataset is provided below:  
   ```
   Smoker: [Yes, No, No, Yes, No, Yes, No, No, Yes, No]  
   Pulse: [72, 68, 70, 75, 69, 74, 67, 71, 73, 70]  
   ```

2. **Task:**  

   - Calculate the mean and median pulse rates for smokers and non-smokers separately.  
   - Compare the variability (standard deviation) of pulse rates between the two groups.  
   - Discuss whether smoking appears to have an effect on pulse rates.

3. **Submit:** Write a brief report summarizing your findings.
