## Introduction to Continuous Probability Distributions

::: cle10
::: font70

Continuous random variables are the backbone of modeling real-world phenomena where outcomes can take any value within a range. Unlike discrete variables, which deal with countable outcomes, continuous variables are described by smooth curves called **Probability Density Functions (PDFs)**.

- **Key Features of PDFs**:
  - **Area as Probability**: The probability that $X$ falls between $a$ and $b$ is the area under the PDF curve between these points.
  - **Non-negativity**: $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$.
  - **Total Probability**: The integral of $f(x)$ over its entire range equals 1, representing certainty.
  - **Zero Probability at a Point**: For continuous variables, $P(X = a) = 0$ for any specific value $a$. Probabilities are only meaningful over intervals.

- **Interpreting the Curve**:  
  The shape of the PDF reflects how probabilities are distributed. A tall, narrow peak indicates values are concentrated around a specific point, while a flat curve suggests more variability.

- **Calculating Probabilities**:  
  To find $P(a \leq X \leq b)$, compute the area under the curve between $a$ and $b$. This is the essence of continuous probability!

## The Uniform Distribution: Simplicity with Power

::: {.callout-note title="Definition"}

The **uniform distribution** models scenarios where every outcome in a range is equally likely. It’s the simplest continuous distribution, yet it’s incredibly useful in practice.

- **PDF**: $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$ for $x \in [a, b]$.
- **Graphical Representation**: A flat rectangle, reflecting equal probability density across the range.

Why Use the Uniform Distribution?

::: font80
::: cle11

- **Equal Likelihood**:  
  It’s ideal for modeling fair processes, such as random number generation or selecting a random time within a fixed interval.

- **Easy Calculations**:  
  Probabilities are straightforward to compute. For example, $P(c \leq X \leq d) = (d-c) \times \frac{1}{b-a}$.

## Statistical Measures of the Uniform Distribution

::: font80
::: cle13

- **Mean and Median**:  
  Both are located at the center of the interval: $\mu = \frac{a+b}{2}$.

- **Variance**:  
  The spread of the distribution is $\sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$. A wider range leads to greater variability.

## Real-World Applications

::: font80
::: cle15

- **Simulations**:  
  Used in computer algorithms to generate random numbers for simulations and modeling.

- **Quality Control**:  
  Helps predict the likelihood of defects when manufacturing tolerances are uniformly distributed.

- **Everyday Scenarios**:  
  From predicting wait times for public transportation to modeling the lifespan of products, the uniform distribution is a versatile tool.

> Example 1: An unprincipled used-car dealer sells a car to an unsuspecting buyer, even though the dealer knows that the car will have a major breakdown within the next 6 months. The dealer provides a warranty of 45 days on all cars sold. Let $x$ represent the length of time until the breakdown occurs. Assume that x is a uniform random variable with values between 0 and 6 months.

a. Calculate and interpret the mean and standard deviation of $X$.

::: font60

b. Graph the probability distribution of $X$ , and show the mean on the horizontal axis. Also show one and two-standard-deviation intervals around the mean.

::: custom-space
:::

c. Calculate the probability that the breakdown occurs while the car is still under warranty.
