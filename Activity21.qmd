## Activity 1: Quiz

- **Question:** Given $\hat{p} = 0.65$, $n = 169$, and a 90% confidence level, calculate the confidence interval for $p$. Use $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.645$.

## Activity 2: Case Studies and Problem-Solving

- **Scenario:** A political campaign wants to estimate the proportion of voters who support their candidate. They survey 500 voters and find that 300 support the candidate.
- **Task:** Apply the concepts learned to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of supporters. Discuss the implications of the confidence interval width on the campaign's strategy.

## Activity 3: Sample Size Calulations

Building on the information and context from Activity 1, design a study where the goal is to calculate the required sample size to achieve a narrower margin of error for the population proportion $p$. Assume a desired sampling error of 0.03 at a $90 \%$ confidence level, maintaining the same population proportion estimate $(\hat{p}=0.65)$. How many individuals should be included in the new sample to meet these precision requirements? If you did not know $p$ in advance, how would you estimate the sample size in advance for the same sampling error?

## Activity 4: Sample Size Calulations

Using the setup of Activity 1, find the sample size needed for a SE of 0.01?
