## Descriptive Statistics

::: bqt
- **Summarize and visualize** data to make sense of it.
- **Descriptive statistics** (or **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**) involves summarizing and visualizing variables and their relationships.
- The methods depend on the type of variable(s) being analyzed (qualitative or quantitative).
:::

## One Qualitative Variable

::: green-h
A random sample of US adults in 2012 were surveyed regarding the type of cell phone owned.

## Frequency Table

::: font50
A frequency table shows the number of cases or counts that fall in each category:

::: row
::: left
::: table-colored
| Subset of Raw Data | Device Type             |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Case 1             | Android                 |
| Case 2             | none                    |
| Case 3             | none                    |
| Case 4             | iPhone                  |
| Case 5             | Non Smartphone          |
| Case 6             | iPhone                  |
| Case 7             | Blackberry              |
| Case 8             | Non Smartphone          |
| Case 9             | Android                 |
| Case 10            | Android                 |
| ...                | (for 2253 cases ...)    |

::: right
::: table-colored
| Cell Phone Type  | Frequency |
|------------------|-----------|
| Android          | 458       |
| iPhone           | 437       |
| Blackberry       | 141       |
| Non Smartphone   | 924       |
| No Cell Phone    | 293       |
| **Total**        | **2253**  |

## Proportion

The proportion in a category is found by:
$$
\text{proportion} = \frac{\text{number in category}}{\text{total sample size}}
$$

::: lqt
- **Population proportion (parameter):** $p$
- **Sample proportion (statistic):** $\hat{p}$ ("p-hat")
:::

## What proportion of adults sampled do not own a cell phone?

::: table-colored
| Cell Phone Type  | Frequency | Proportion |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Android          | 458       | 0.203      |
| iPhone           | 437       | 0.194      |
| Blackberry       | 141       | 0.063      |
| Non Smartphone   | 924       | 0.410      |
| No Cell Phone    | 293       | 0.130      |
| **Total**        | **2253**  | **1.000**  |
:::

## Bar Chart

In a barplot, the height of the bar corresponds to the number of cases falling in each category.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(cell_phone_data, aes(x = Type, y = Frequency)) +
  geom_col(fill = c("darkblue", "red", "green", "orange", "purple")) +
  labs(x = "Cell Phone Type", y = "Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Cell Phone Usage") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))
```

## Two Qualitative Variables

::: font80
Look at the relationship between two qualitative variables:

- **Relationship status**
- **Gender**

::: table-colored
|                  | Female | Male | Total |
|------------------|--------|------|-------|
| In a Relationship | 32     | 10   | 42    |
| It's Complicated | 12     | 7    | 19    |
| Single           | 63     | 45   | 108   |
| **Total**        | **107**| **62**| **169**|
:::
:::


## Relationship Status and Gender

::: eqt

**Proportion of students in a relationship that are female?**

```{r}
prop.relation.female <- 32/42
round(prop.relation.female, 2)
```

**Proportion of students in a relationship that are male?**

```{r}
prop.relation.male <- 10/42
round(prop.relation.male, 2)
```

:::

## Difference in Proportions

::: bql
::: font80
A difference in proportions is a difference in proportions for one qualitative variable calculated for different levels of the other qualitative variable.

**Example:** Difference in proportions of male and female that are in a relationship:
$$
\hat{p}_F - \hat{p}_M = \frac{32}{107} - \frac{10}{62} = 0.14
$$

```{r}
prop.female <- 32/107
prop.male <- 10/62
prop.diff <- prop.female - prop.male
round(prop.diff, 2)
```
:::
:::

## Student Survey

Dataset on 362 responses to a student survey given at one college.

::: font50
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(survey |> select(-c(4,5,6, 13,14, 15, 18)))
```
:::


## Distribution

> In the given dataset, there are multiple variables (such as Gender, Smoke, Exercise, Height, Weight, etc.) for different students across various academic years.

Knowing the distribution of each variable can help us identify relationships, trends, and potential anomalies in the data.

## Distribution

::: green-h
"The distribution of the variable Y" describes its **center**, **variability**, and **shape** using both numbers and graphics.
:::


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
# Load the MASS package
library(MASS)

# Load the crabs dataset
data(crabs)

ggplot(crabs, aes(x = CL)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, col = "gold", fill = "lightblue") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Carpace length") +
  theme_minimal()
```



## Center: Mean or Average

::: bqt
- **Mean:** Average value in a sample or population.
  - Sample mean: $\bar{y} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{n}$
  - Population mean: $\mu$
:::

```{r}
mean(survey$Pulse)
```

::: green-h
The mean pulse rate for this sample of students is $\bar{y} = 69.6$ beats per minute.
:::

## Center: Median

::: bql
- **Median:** The middle value when the data are ordered.
  - Sample median: $m$
  - Population median: $M$
:::

```{r}
median(survey$Pulse)
```

::: green-h
The median pulse rate for this sample of students is $m = 70$ beats per minute.
:::

## Variability: Standard Deviation

::: bq
::: font80

- **Standard Deviation (SD):** Average deviation from the center in a sample or population.
  - Sample SD: $s = \sqrt{ \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \overline{y})^2}{n-1}}$
  - Population SD: $\sigma$
:::

```{r}
sd(survey$Pulse)
```

::: green-h
The SD of pulse rates for this sample of students is $s = 12.2$ beats per minute. The "average" deviation of individual pulse rates around the mean value is about 12.2 beats per minute.
