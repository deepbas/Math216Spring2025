## Introduction to Hypothesis Testing {.font80}

::: cle6

- Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to decide whether to support or refute a specific claim about a population parameter based on sample data.
- Analogous to a judicial process: The null hypothesis ($H_0$) represents the "status quo" (e.g., "innocent until proven guilty").
:::

## Elements of a Test of Hypothesis {.font80}

::: cle7
- City regulations require residential sewer pipes to have an average breaking strength greater than 2,400 pounds per foot.
- Manufacturers must demonstrate that their products meet this standard.

#### Hypotheses {.font80}

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: In theory, $\mu \leq 2400$. If we reject $\mu = 2400$, $\mu < 2400$ is also rejected.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: $\mu > 2400$ (Pipes meet or exceed the standard).
:::


## Testing the Hypothesis {.font80}

Computation of Test Statistic

- By the Central Limit Theorem, for large samples ($n \geq 30$), $\bar{x}$ approximates a normal distribution.
- Test statistic $z$: 
  $$
  z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
  $$
  where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $\mu_0 = 2400$.

## Decision Making {.font80}

::: cle6
- If the observed $\bar{x}$ exceeds 1.645 standard deviations above 2,400, we consider rejecting $H_0$.
- Rejection implies that a rare event (occurring with probability $\leq 0.05$ under $H_0$) is unlikely without true cause (i.e., $H_a$ is likely true).

::: 

## Evidence from Sample Data {.font80}

::: cle7

- **Sample Characteristics:**
  - Number of samples ($n$): 50
  - Mean strength ($\bar{x}$): 2,460 pounds per linear foot
  - Standard deviation ($s$): 200 pounds per linear foot

- **Test Statistic Calculation:**
  - The test statistic ($z$) is calculated as follows:
  $$
  z = \frac{\bar{x} - 2400}{s/\sqrt{n}} \approx \frac{2460 - 2400}{200 / \sqrt{50}} = \frac{60}{28.28} \approx 2.12
  $$

## Types of Errors {.font80}

::: cle9

Type I Error

- **Analogy**: Convicting an innocent person.
- Occurs if we reject $H_0$ when it is, in fact, true.
- Probability of Type I error is denoted by $\alpha$ (commonly set at 0.05).

:::

## Types of Errors {.font80}

::: cle10

Type II Error

- **Analogy**: Acquitting a guilty person.
- Occurs if we fail to reject $H_0$ when, in fact, $H_a$ is true.
- Probability of Type II error is denoted by $\beta$.
- Unlike $\alpha$, $\beta$ is not usually pre-specified but affected by the sample size, effect size, and the set $\alpha$.

## Rejection Region {.font80}

::: cle11
- The set of values of the test statistic that lead us to reject $H_0$.
- For this test, it's values greater than the z-value corresponding to a 0.05 probability in the upper tail of the normal distribution.

## Summary {.font80}

::: cle12
- **Hypothesis Testing as a Judicial Process**:
  - $H_0$: The defendant (population parameter) is presumed innocent (equals 2400) until proven otherwise.
  - $H_a$: Claims the defendant is not innocent (greater than 2400).
  - We examine the "evidence" (sample data) to decide whether it sufficiently supports $H_a$ over $H_0$.

:::

## Hypothesis Test: Step-by-Step Procedure {.font40}

::: cle15

1. **State the Hypotheses**
   - Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): Assume the status quo or a specific value (e.g., $\mu = 2400$).
   - Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$): Proposes a different scenario (e.g., $\mu > 2400$).

2. **Assume $H_0$ is True**
   - Collect data under the assumption that $H_0$ holds.

3. **Compute the Test Statistic**
   - Use the formula:
     $$
     z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
     $$
   - $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\mu_0$ is the value under $H_0$, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.

4. **Determine the Significance Level**
   - Commonly set at $\alpha = 0.05$.
   - Decide if the computed $z$ value suggests a rare event:
     - If $z > 1.645$, it's considered unusual under the assumption that $H_0$ is true.

5. **Make a Decision**
   - Reject $H_0$ if the test statistic falls in the rejection region (e.g., $z > 1.645$ for $\alpha = 0.05$).
   - If not, fail to reject $H_0$.
