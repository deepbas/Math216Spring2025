## The Concept of a Sampling Distribution {.font80}

::: cle1
- **Background**: Traditionally, the exact probability distribution of a population is unknown, and we rely on sample data to make inferences.
- **Definitions**:
  - **Parameter**: A fixed, often unknown characteristic of a population.
  - **Statistic**: A characteristic of a sample, used as an estimate of the population parameter.
:::

## Calculating Sample Statistics {.font80}

::: cle2
- **Point Estimators**:
  - Sample mean ($\bar{x}$): $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum x_i}{n}$
  - Sample variance ($s^2$): $s^2=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$
- **Usage**: These estimators help approximate the population mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^2$).
:::

## Unbiasedness and Minimum Variance {.font80}

::: cle3
- **Unbiased Estimators**: An estimator is unbiased if it consistently represents the population parameter across different samples.
- **Minimum Variance**: Among unbiased estimators, preference is given to those with smaller variances, as they tend to produce more reliable estimates.

## List of relevant parameters {.font80}

## {.font60}

> Example 1: Suppose two statistics, $A$ and $B$, exist to estimate the same population parameter $\theta$ (theta). (Note that $\theta$ could be any parameter: $\mu, \sigma^2$, etc.) Suppose the two statistics have sampling distributions as shown in the following figure. On the basis of these sampling distributions, which statistic is more attractive as an estimator of $\theta$ ?

## Standard Error and Estimation Error {.font80}

::: cle4
- **Standard Error**: The standard deviation of the sampling distribution, providing a measure of the spread of the estimates.
- **Estimation Error**: Reflects how much an estimate derived from a sample statistic is expected to differ from the actual population parameter.
:::

## Comparing Sampling Distributions {.font80}

::: cle5
- **Visual Example**: Two sampling distributions for statistics A and B might show different spreads (standard deviations), indicating the reliability of the estimates.
- **Selection Criterion**: Statistic with a smaller standard error is preferred as it is likely to be closer to the population parameter.
:::

## Practical Implications {.font80}

::: cle6
- **Inference**: Sampling distributions allow us to make educated guesses about population parameters.
- **Application**: Essential in fields like epidemiology, economics, and quality control where population parameters are not directly observable.

> Example 2: The rolling machine of a steel manufacturer produces sheets of steel of varying thickness. The thickness of a steel sheet follows a uniform distribution with values between 150 and 200 millimeters. Suppose we perform the following experiment over and over again: Randomly sample 11 steel sheets from the production line and record the thickness x of each. Calculate the two sample statistics:

$$
\bar{x}=\text { Sample mean }=\sum x / 11
$$

$M=$ Median = Sixth sample measurement when the 11 thicknesses 1 are arranged in ascending order
Obtain approximations to the sampling distributions of $\bar{x}$ and $M$.
Since we know that it is uniform distribution, the mean is 175 mm . But let's assume that we don't know that and just use the sampling to approximate the parameter.

Say hi to your group members and discuss which distribution is better and why.
