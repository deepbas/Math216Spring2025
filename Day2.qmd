## Sampling and Inference

::: cle9
- A **population** includes all individuals or objects of interest.
- A **sample** is all the cases that we have collected data on (a subset of the population).
- **Statistical inference** is the process of using data from a sample to gain information about the population.

**Population**

- All blue crabs in the Maryland Coastal Bays (MCB).
- Includes sub-estuaries: Assawoman Bay, St. Martin River, Isle of Wight, Sinepuxent Bay, Newport Bay, Chincoteague Bay.

**Sample**

- Blue crabs collected from 20 sites within MCB.
- Sample period: April - December, 2014-2016.
- Method: Trawl surveys.

**Variables**

- **Primary Variable**: Carapace width, sex, maturity status, molt stage.

**Inference**

- Population structure of blue crabs in MCB.
- Seasonal variations: size distribution, molt cycles, reproductive patterns.

# Sampling Bias

::: bq
- Sampling bias occurs when the method of selecting a sample causes the sample to differ from the population in some relevant way.
- If sampling bias exists, we cannot trust generalizations from the sample to the population.
:::

To eliminate sampling bias, always take a <span class="bold-text">RANDOM SAMPLE!</span>

# Bias in Data

> Even with a random sample, data can still be biased, especially when collected on humans.

::: lqt
Some forms of bias to watch out for in data collection:

- Question wording.
- Question order.
- Context.
- Non-response bias.
:::

### Question Wording

::: green-h
A random sample was asked: “Should there be a tax cut, or should money be used to fund new government programs?”
:::

| Tax Cut | Programs |
|---------|----------|
| 60%     | 40%      |
:::

::: centered-content
### Question Wording

::: green-h
A different random sample was asked: “Should there be a tax cut, or should money be spent on programs for education, the environment, health care, crime-fighting, and military defense?”
:::

| Tax Cut | Programs |
|---------|----------|
| 22%     | 78%      |
:::

::: centered-content
## Question Order

::: bq
- Depending on the order of questions, we can see either greater or lesser differences in responses.
- Respondents tend to provide answers consistent with their prior responses.

## [Swedish Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09630-5): Response Bias

## Identified Sources of Bias in `Swedish Study`

::: bqt
`Political Bias:` The study experimentally primes the political affiliations of the respondents before asking questions about corruption. This bias arises when people's political leanings affect their perception and reporting of corruption levels.
:::

::: bqt
`Sensitivity Bias:` Questions about one's experiences with corruption are sensitive in nature and may result in biased responses due to fear of retribution or social stigma.
:::
:::

::: centered-content
## Context

::: green-h
**Ann Landers** column asked readers *“If you had it to do over again, would you have children?”*

The first request for data contained a letter from a young couple which listed worries about parenting and various reasons not to have kids.

$$30\% \text{ said yes}$$
:::
:::

::: centered-content
## Context

::: green-h
The second request for data was in response to this number, in which Ann wrote how she was *“stunned, disturbed, and just plain flummoxed.”*

$$95\% \text{ said yes}$$
:::
:::

::: centered-content
## Non-response Bias

> When respondents are either unable or unwilling to respond to your survey, this results in non-response bias.

::: bq
- Survey targeted to the wrong audience.
- There is general unwillingness due to polar opposite opinions.
- The survey did not reach the right respondent.
  - e.g., A survey asking teenagers about the best cigarette brands.

### Experiment vs. Observational Study

::: lqt
An [observational study]{.bold-text} is a study in which the researcher does not actively control the value of any variable but simply observes the values as they naturally exist.
:::

::: lqt
An [experiment]{.bold-text} is a study in which the researcher actively controls one or more of the explanatory variables.

## Experiment or Observational Study?

::: bq
To examine whether farm-grown salmon contain more omega-3 oils if water is more acidic, we collect samples of salmon and water from multiple fish farms to see if the two variables are related.
:::

<details>
<summary class="answer">Click for answer</summary>
This is an observational study because the researchers do not actively manipulate or control the acidity of the water; they simply observe the naturally occurring conditions at each fish farm.

## Conclusion: Statistical Thinking!

::: green-h
**Statistical thinking** involves applying rational thought and the science of statistics to critically assess data and inferences. Fundamental to the thought process is that variation exists in populations of data.
