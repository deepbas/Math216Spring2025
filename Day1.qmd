## Class Pipelines

<br>

::: bql
- Most of the course information and schedule will be posted in [MyClasses](https://salisbury.instructure.com/courses/67043)
- Bookmark the class helper webpage [https://math216-spring25.netlify.app/](https://math216-spring25.netlify.app/)
- Homework will be posted but not collected
- Labs most Thursdays; lab reports due in [MyClasses](https://salisbury.instructure.com/courses/70757) a week from the lab date
- Quizzes every Friday in-person; includes HW, lectures, labs

  - Work on homework/lab, come with questions
- During class:
  - Mini lectures
  - Class activities

# Statistics 

Statistics is the study of data and the uncertainties surrounding them. We will take a more conceptual route to statistics in this course.
:::

::: centered-content
### What and Why of Statistics?

::: lqt
Science of collecting, describing, analyzing, and making decisions based on data:

- Sampling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Inference
:::

::: green-h
Allows us to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty and lets us take an unbiased, evidence-based viewpoint.
:::
:::

## Statistical Computation

<br>
<br>

::: bq
- Statistical computing software called R
- RStudio/Posit provides a user-friendly interface to R
- R Markdown is a platform in Posit to write your codes and results
:::

## Data: Units and Variables

::: bqt
**Experimental (or Observational) Unit**

An experimental (or observational) unit is an object (e.g., person, thing, transaction, or event) about which we collect data.
:::

::: cle6
Data is stored and presented in a dataset that comprises variables measured on units.

- A **variable** is any characteristic that is recorded for each unit.
:::
:::

::: centered-content
### An Example: High School Student Analysis

::: scrollable
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(openintro)
data(hsb2)
hsb2 %>% head() %>% knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
:::

Each row = unit & Each column = variable.
:::

::: centered-content
## Qualitative Versus Quantitative

> Variables are classified as either **qualitative** or **quantitative:**

::: cle2
- A **qualitative variable** categorizes cases (e.g., diabetic status: yes/no, type of diabetes)
- A **quantitative variable** records numerical measurements (e.g., blood glucose levels, BMI, HbA1c %)
:::
:::


## Diabetes Prevalence

<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18160/us-states-with-highest-diabetes-rates/" title="Infographic: Where Diabetes is Most Prevalent in the U.S. | Statista"><img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/18160.jpeg" alt="Infographic: Where Diabetes is Most Prevalent in the U.S. | Statista" width="100%" height="auto" style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:960px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;"/></a> 

::: centered-content
## Diabetes Analysis

> If cases are individual patients:

::: green-h
Patient diabetic status (yes/no) is qualitative classification
:::

<br>

> If cases are US states:

::: green-h
Diabetes prevalence rates (%) are quantitative measurements
:::

:::

::: centered-content
## Variable Manipulations

::: bq
Can use numbers to code categories of qualitative variables.

- e.g., Gender (0 for male and 1 for female).
:::

<br>

::: bq
Can convert quantitative variables into qualitative groups.

- e.g., Income (0-50000 as Low, 50000+ as High).

We will have interactive elements in every class that could be:

- Think-pair-share
- Quiz
- Interactive Data Exploration
- Group Activities with Real Data

This is the time for you to gauge your understanding of the concepts and have fun with the content. These may be collected for attendance! Please bring your charged laptop to every class.
