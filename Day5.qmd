## Introduction to Probability


::: cle6
::: font80

- **Experiment**: Any act of observation with uncertain outcomes (e.g., tossing a coin).
- **Observation**: The result of an experiment (e.g., heads or tails).

### Mathematical Representation

- Let $E$ represent an experiment.
- An outcome of $E$ is an element of the sample space $S$.
- Probability of an event $A$ is denoted by $P(A)$.

## What is Probability?

::: row
::: left

::: cle6
::: font70

- **Probability** is a measure of how likely an event is to occur.
- Think of it as the "chance" or "likelihood" of something happening.
- Example: The chance of rain tomorrow, the likelihood of rolling a 6 on a die.

## Definitions

::: cle15
::: font80

### Sample Point
- **Definition**: The most basic outcome of an experiment.
- **Example**: In a coin toss, each toss that results in H (Head) or T (Tail).

### Sample Space
- **Definition**: Collection of all possible outcomes (sample points) of an experiment.
- **Example**: In a coin toss, the sample space is $S = \{H, T\}$.

## Venn Diagram 

::: cle6
::: font70

- **Sample Space (S)**: Represented as a closed figure in the diagram.
- **Sample Points**: Each possible outcome shown as a solid dot within the figure.

**Example: Coin Toss**

- **Venn Diagram**: Circle labeled S containing two points labeled H (Head) and T (Tail).
- **Representation**: Helps visualize all possible outcomes in a single view.

## Experiments and Their Sample Spaces

::: cle15
::: font50

**Experiment: Tossing a Coin**

- **Sample Space (S)**: 
  $$S = \{H, T\}$$

**Experiment: Rolling a Die**

- **Sample Space (S)**: 
  $$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$

**Experiment: Tossing Two Coins**

- **Sample Space (S)**: 
  $$S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$$

## Defining Probability

::: cle14
::: font70

**Probability of a Sample Point**: Number between 0 and 1 indicating likelihood of the outcome.

Rules of Probability

1. **Range of Probabilities**:
   - Each probability $p_i$ must satisfy:
     $$0 \leq p_i \leq 1$$

2. **Sum of Probabilities**:
   - The total probability across all sample points must sum to 1:
     $$\sum_{\text{all } i} p_i = 1$$

## Example: Calculating Winning Probability in a Dice Game

::: cle13
::: font50

::: row
::: left

- **Experiment**: Tossing a fair die.
- **Winning Condition**: If the up face is an even number (2, 4, 6), you win $1.
- **Losing Condition**: If the up face is odd (1, 3, 5), you lose $1.

Sample Space and Probabilities

- **Sample Space (S)**:
  $$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$
- **Uniform Probabilities**:
  $$p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \cdots = p_6 = \frac{1}{6}$$

:::

::: right

Calculation of Winning Probability

- **Event of Winning**:
  $$\text{Winning} = \{2, 4, 6\}$$
- **Probability of Winning**:
  $$\text{Prob of Winning} = p_2 + p_4 + p_6 = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$

## Event Definition 

::: cle3

Definition of an Event

- **Event (A)**: A collection of sample points.
- **Example**: Rolling an even number on a die.

Probability of an Event

- **Calculation**: Sum of probabilities of all sample points in the event.


:::

## Steps for Calculating Event Probabilities

::: cle12
::: font60
::: row
::: left

1. **Define the Experiment**: Describe the observation process.
2. **List Sample Points**: Identify possible outcomes.
3. **Assign Probabilities**: Allocate probability to each sample point.
4. **Identify Event's Sample Points**: Determine which sample points are part of the event.
5. **Calculate Event Probability**: Sum the probabilities of the event's sample points.

:::

::: right

**Example**

- **Experiment**: Tossing a coin twice.
- **Sample Points**: {HH, HT, TH, TT}
- **Event**: Getting at least one head.
- **Calculation**: Probability(HH) + Probability(HT) + Probability(TH)

## Compound Events: Unions 

::: cle8

- **Definition**: Union of two events $A$ and $B$ ($A \cup B$)
- **Occurs If**: Either event $A$, event $B$, or both happen.
- **Composition**: Includes all sample points in $A$, $B$, or both.
  $$A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$$


:::

---

## Compound Events: Intersections

::: cle9
- **Definition**: Intersection of two events $A$ and $B$ ($A \cap B$)
- **Occurs If**: Both event $A$ and event $B$ happen.
- **Composition**: Includes all sample points that are in both $A$ and $B$.
  $$A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$$


:::

---

## Example: Calculating Unions and Intersections in a Die-Toss

::: font70
::: cle10

::: row
::: left

- **Event A**: Toss an even number.
  $$A = \{2, 4, 6\}$$
- **Event B**: Toss a number less than or equal to 3.
  $$B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$
- **Sample Space (S)**:
  $$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$

:::

::: right

- **Union ($A \cup B$)**:
  $$A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}$$
- **Intersection ($A \cap B$)**:
  $$A \cap B = \{2\}$$
- **Probability of Union ($P(A \cup B)$)**:
  $$P(A \cup B) = \frac{5}{6}$$
- **Probability of Intersection ($P(A \cap B)$)**:
  $$P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6}$$
