## Recap: Steel Sheets Thickness{.font80}


::: cle13

- **Context**: We revisit the scenario from Section 6.1 where a steel manufacturer's rolling machine produces sheets of varying thickness, distributed uniformly between 150 and 200 millimeters.
- **Experiment Setup**: Random sampling of 11 steel sheets to measure thickness, repeated across 1000 samples.

## Uniform Distribution Parameters {.font80}

::: cle6

- **Distribution Type**: Uniform, with each value between 150 and 200 mm equally likely.
- **Calculated Mean**: $\mu = \frac{150 + 200}{2} = 175$ mm.
- **Calculated Standard Deviation**: $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(200 - 150)^2}{12}} \approx 14.43$ mm.

## Sample Mean and Estimation {.font80}


::: cle10

- **Sample Mean**: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{11}$
- **Role of Sample Mean**: Serves as a better statistic to approximate the population mean, especially useful when population parameters are unknown.
- **Unbiased Estimator**: $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum X_i$ is unbiased, meaning $E(\bar{x}) = \mu$.

:::


## Properties of the Sampling Distribution {.font70}


::: cle6
- **Mean of Sampling Distribution**: Equals the population mean, i.e., $E(\bar{x}) = \mu$.
- **Standard Error of the Mean (SE)**: $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ for sample size \(n\).
- **Implication**: The standard error quantifies the spread of the sampling distribution around the population mean.

:::



## Central Limit Theorem (CLT) {.font80}

::: cle15

- **Theorem Statement**: For any population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\bar{x}$ will be approximately normal if the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large (typically $n \geq 30$).
- **Application**: This theorem applies regardless of the original population's distribution, making it a powerful tool in statistical inference.


:::

## Impact of Sample Size {.font80}

::: cle11
- **Visualization**: Tells us how increasing sample size narrows the spread of the sampling distribution, aligning closer to a normal distribution.
- **Practical Implication**: Larger sample sizes lead to more precise estimations of the population mean, emphasizing the importance of sample size in experimental design.

## Normal Approx. for Poisson   

::: cle4
::: font60
 
- **Poisson Properties**: For $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$:  
  - Mean: $\mu = \lambda$  
  - Variance: $\sigma^2 = \lambda$  
  - *Shape*: Right-skewed for small $\lambda$, but becomes approximately normal as $\lambda$ grows ($\lambda > 10$ is often sufficient).  

- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**:  
  For large sample sizes $n$, the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ is approximately normal:  
  $$  
  \bar{X} \approx N\left(\mu_{\bar{x}} = \lambda,\ \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{n}}\right)  
  $$  
  Even if the population is Poisson, the sample mean becomes normal when $n$ is large.
